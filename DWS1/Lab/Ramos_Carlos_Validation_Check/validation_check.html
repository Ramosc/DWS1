<h1>Website Validation Check</h1>
<p>1. http://www.thephinsider.com/ <br> A website that follows and provides news on the Miami Dolphins <br>
        Did not pass inspection has 4 errors with 1 warnings <br> The first error I don't understand and have never seen
        (The character encoding was not declared. Proceeding using windows-1252.) and the other three on the same line
        of the meta charset and the only thing I see missing from there is the / at the end.
<br>2. http://wqam.com/ <br> A website for a Miami sports talk radio channel. <br> Did not pass inspection has 3 errors
         no warnings <br> All errors are on line 1 but different columns it seems some child elements might be missing,
         a characters is not allowed.
<br>3. http://www.smashingmagazine.com/ <br> A website for web developers. <br> Did not pass inspection with 3 errors and
        1 warning. <br> I am not sure what these errors are but the seem to me like it involves the CSS.
        (Bad value msapplication-TileColor for attribute name on element meta: Keyword msapplication-tilecolor is not registered.),
        And the other error is missing an escape element.
<br>4. http://alistapart.com/ <br> A website for web designers, <br> Did not pass inspections with 3 errors and 1 warning.
    <br> Again I believe these errors have to do with the CSS because it deals with color, image, and image toolbar.</p>
